              June 2024 - September 2024</p>
            <p>During my internship at Pack | Fey, I gained valuable experience in high-end real estate by supporting agents in luxury property transactions. My responsibilities included developing listing materials, assisting with client communication, and coordinating open houses and client viewings to ensure a professional and welcoming environment. I also played a key role in preparing marketing materials, such as property brochures, social media content, and website updates. Through this role, I gained exposure to real estate transactions, luxury market analysis, and client relationship management, benefiting from direct mentorship in the industry.</p>
