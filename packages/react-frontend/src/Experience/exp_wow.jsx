            <p>After over 10 weeks of training, I led a five-day orientation program for my group of 24 incoming freshmen at Cal Poly. I guided them through structured, day-long activities—from 8 AM to 10 PM—that introduced essential aspects of campus life, local culture, and academic expectations. Additionally, I led processing sessions after lectures to ensure a smooth transition into the college environment.</p>
