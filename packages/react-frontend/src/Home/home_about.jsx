            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a second-year Computer Science major at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, concentrating in Cybersecurity. I chose cybersecurity because I have loved logic and puzzles throughout my life and I see security challenges as the ultimate puzzle. I haven’t settled on a specific domain within cybersecurity yet, however, I am excited to explore and figure out what is right for me.</p>
            <p>My experiences as an Orientation Leader and in front-of-house hospitality have been instrumental in sharpening my communication and people-management abilities, enabling me to thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments. These roles have not only strengthened my leadership skills but also taught me the importance of effective teamwork and dynamic problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Outside the classroom, I embrace photography as a creative outlet that complements my analytical pursuits. Photography allows me to capture unique perspectives and express my creativity, further enriching my personal and professional development.</p>
