            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I’m a second-year Computer Science major at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I chose cybersecurity because I have loved logic and puzzles throughout my life and I see security challenges as the ultimate puzzle. I haven’t settled on a specific domain within cybersecurity yet, however, I am excited to explore and figure out what is right for me.</p>
            <p>My experiences as an Orientation Leader and in front-of-house hospitality have strengthened my communication and people-management skills, allowing me to collaborate seamlessly on projects. Outside the classroom, I love photography because it gives me a creative outlet, and allows me to create, capture, and explore. </p>
